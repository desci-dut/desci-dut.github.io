    <p>
      Zhen Zhang received his Ph. D. in management science and engineering from Dalian University of Technology in 2014. He also holds a B.S. in Engineering Management from China University of Petroleum (East China). From Oct. 2012 to Nov. 2013, he was a visiting Ph. D. student with the Decision Systems and e-Service Intelligence Laboratory, Centre for Quantum Computation & Intelligent Systems, University of Technology, Sydney under the supervision of Prof. Jie Lu (AO, FIEEE) and A/Prof. Guangquan Zhang. He was also a visiting scholar with the Department of Computer Science, University of Jaén from Nov. 2016 to Dec. 2016. He is now a professor and a deputy director of the Institute of Systems Engineering, School of Economics and Management, Dalian University of Technology, as well as a core member of the Creative Research Group supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC). </p>
    
    <p>His current research interests include computing with words, group decision making, multi-criteria decision making, preference learning, and complex network. He authored one monograph and more than 70 papers on refereed journals and conference proceedings, including European Journal of Operational Research，IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems, IEEE Transactions on Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems, IEEE Transactions on Computational Social Systems, Omega, Journal of the Operational Research Society, Annals of Operations Research, Computers &amp; Operations Research, Knowledge-Based Systems, Computers &amp; Industrial Engineering, Information Fusion, Information Sciences, Applied Soft Computing, among others.
